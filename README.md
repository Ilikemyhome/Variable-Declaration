# Understanding `const` and `let` in JavaScript

This project demonstrates how to correctly replace `var` with `let` or `const` in modern JavaScript. Each example includes comments explaining why a specific keyword is appropriate and what issues would occur if the other keyword were used.

## Overview
The goal of this assignment is to understand:
- When to use `let` vs `const`
- How variable reassignment affects keyword choice
- Why `var` should be avoided in modern JavaScript
- How block scoping improves code safety

## Concepts Covered
- Variable declaration keywords (`var`, `let`, `const`)
- Reassignment vs mutation
- Block scope vs function scope
- Best practices for modern JavaScript

## Code Explanation
The code includes several examples:
- Reassigning a string variable
- Declaring block‑scoped variables inside conditionals
- Using loop counters inside `for` loops
- Mutating arrays vs reassigning arrays
- Declaring true constants that should never change

Each snippet replaces `var` with either `let` or `const` and includes comments explaining:
- Why the chosen keyword is correct
- What would happen if the other keyword were used
- How scoping rules affect behavior
